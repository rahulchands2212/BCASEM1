structure :- a structure is the collection of heterogeneous data type grouped togethere under a single name . the variable inside the structure are called members.
we can access members by dot operator.
all members have there own separate memory.
cpu add padding for fast data read thats the reason they consume extra memroy space.

syntax:-
struct structure_name{
    member_1;
    member_2;
    member_3;
}s;     //s is struct variable for access members;

example;

#include<stdio.h>
 
 struct student{
        char name[20];
       int  standard;
    }s;


int main(){
   printf("enter name : ");
   fgets(s.name,20,stdin);

   printf("enter standard : ");
   scanf("%d",&s.standard);

   printf("%s",s.name);
   printf("%d",s.standard);

   return 0;
}
