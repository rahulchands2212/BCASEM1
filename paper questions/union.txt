union:- A union in C is a collection of heterogeneous data members grouped under a single name.
All members of a union share the same memory location, therefore only one member can store a value at a time.
The size of a union is equal to the size of its largest data member.

we can access the members by dot operator and pointer operator.

difference of structure and union:-
in structure members have there own seperate memory space.          in union members share memorys each other.
in structure total memory = sum of all members + padding.           in union total memory =  bigest member.
in structure we access multiple members.                           in union we access members only one time .
define structure with struct keyword.                               define union with union keyword.

sytax:-

union union_name{
    members;
    members2;
}s;

example:-
#include<stdio.h>

union student{
char name[20];
int age;
}s;

int main(){
    printf("enter name : ");
    fgets(s.name,20,stdin);

    printf("name : %s",s.name);

    printf("enter age : ");
    scanf("%d",&s.age);

    printf("age : %d",s.age);

    return 0;
}
